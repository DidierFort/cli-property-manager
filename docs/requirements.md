# Requirements
In order to run sdk commands you need to be able to install software downloaded from third party sites.
You need following packages:
1. Unix like shell environment. Mac OSX, Linux or similar operating system has this out of the box.
1. nodejs + npm, version 8.9.1 or later. (currently 8.9.4 is the latest LTS version of nodejs). 
Apparently nodejs 9.5.0, which is the latest also works. 
1. Akamai Open client id. See https://developer.akamai.com/introduction/Prov_Creds.html . 
Store the credentials in a file called client.properties inside the projects folder.
